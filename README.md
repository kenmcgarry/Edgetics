# Edgetics
This is R work in progress and does not represent the finished source code!

The majority of complex biological functions in the cell occur as a result of one or more cellular components exerting their influence on other cellular components. Many of these functions are based upon protein interactions and a large body of scientific evidence exists in the form of protein to protein interaction databases. The relationships between proteins can be represented by graphs where the proteins are the nodes (vertices) and the interactions between them are represented by links (edges). Recent work with these databases has revealed the modular nature of proteins as they cooperative to achieve various functions but also that diseases are  interlinked within their own networks. In this paper we show how modifications to the network structure by deleting and adding links (edges) can represent mutations within the gene and account for the nature of some diseases. This emerging new field called 'edgetics' is starting to provide an explanation of disease causing mutations.
